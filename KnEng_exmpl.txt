Here are some questions that were asked from the manager that they answered in Green:

Is the position remote? If so - any travel needs like monthly or quarterly to be on site? Position can be remote. No travel likely
With your magic eight ball - what would be the optimal or desired start date (knowing I know the Ford procurement process and general timelines :)) and duration? It is still tentative. Since it is a rare skillset, wanted to give a heads up. Will be in first quarter
Is having a manufacturing or automotive background a must have, nice to have, or not needed? Definitely a nice to have.
What would be your preferred experience in years and on the scale of 1-5 from novice to expert? With this profile , I think it will be close to 5 . if you can find with less than 5, we can still consider it
Of the first five bullet points before SQL are there two or three that are must haves? 2 to 4 are must haves ( Lisp programmer who has used LISP Works / Knowledge Works )
